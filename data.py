The staff and owner* was so friendly, nice & welcoming. The carefully curated selections and attention to quality details is astounding. Everything we looked at and touched you could tell has been well maintained and is continued to be shown the love it deserves in a piece. They also had a beautiful Burberry coat from the 80‚Äôs that looked brand new. Of all the stores side by side, THIS IS THE ONE to stop in for sure. You‚Äôre sure to find something you love or a wonderful find as a gift for someone else. The store is spacious, has fitting rooms, and an all around good vibe. They have some luxury items as well. Check it out! üòéüíéüß•",

            "review": "I have visited this location so many times and I'm always blown away by something I find. This is one of three current Seven Wonders Collective locations and it is the mid-sized one of the three. This location has nice large windows so there's always a cheery atmosphere (there was a nice friendly dog who belongs to the owner of Tomatoes Vintage who was there while I shopped last time ‚Äî made the shopping even better!). This location has it all: tops, bottoms, outwear, dresses, footwear, accessories, (most items are on the casual side I'd say, though you can of course dress anything up) and is organized well. It is easy to navigate. And there are fitting rooms. Because this is a collective, there are a handful of vintage sellers who sell pieces they've collected at this shop and each seller brings their own taste. For example, I love AllyBirdVintage for her eye for 70s pieces and I always just happen to love every piece with an OK Vintage tag on it. But every seller has some seriously amazing stuff!! Because there are different sellers involved, a wide variety of styles are represented. This is a curated vintage store, which means that the sellers take their time to source specific pieces and get them into great shape so that we can enjoy them right off the hanger. That also means you won't find thrift store prices here ‚Äî think investment pieces. This store seems to mostly carry items from the 1950s/60s and later. I don't know that I've seen any items from earlier decades at this location. I was obsessed with this pink coat from OK Vintage when I went in recently!"
